This is a hackathon project to try to scaffold Perseus from scratch.

To run locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/handeyeco/perseus-consumer.git
yarn
yarn dev
```

I wanted to see what the minimum amount of work it would take to bootstrap Perseus up to the point where:

1. I could render a built-in Perseus widget
2. I could render a custom Perseus widget
3. I could answer and score them
